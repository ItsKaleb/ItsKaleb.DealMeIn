### PlantUML

This repo contains multiple design artifacts in the form of PlantUML diagrams.

The dev container for this repo includes the necessary configuration to allow viewing of these artifacts in VS Code.

The `docker-compose.yml` for this dev container includes a container instance for the PlantUML server image.

Additionally, the `devcontainer.json` file includes the necessary configuration for installing the required VS Code extensions, and configuring them.

Simply launch the workspace in the dev container, select one of the `.puml` or `.iuml` design artifacts, and use `Alt+D` to view the diagram.
